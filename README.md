## Problem Statement:    
On the Data page, the tables, despite informative, are not presented in a way that provides clarity to the average user.  
The table should be easy to understand for the average user and have an option for an advanced view that will open up a popup 
window with all the extra information that was not included.  Also, there should be an explanation of each of the attributes
in the table.  For instance, have a short description of what the Clean Air Act and what PBT means. Adding an attribute to the 
table that would tell the number of facilities the chemical is in, or for the facilities having an attribute for the numbers of 
chemicals in each facility would also be a good feature to implement in the system.  
                        
## Module Objective:                    
The overall objective of our module is to clearly display the data to the end user.  

Implementing an advanced view of the chemicals and facilities to users who would need the advanced information, and a regular 
view which would only provide the basic data. this would allow people that would need the information 


### Part 1: Implementing the advanced and regular views    

1.  Creating an advanced view based on the intent of the user
If the user is someone that works with the chemicals at a facility, they will be able to view the whole page with 
all the advanced information. They will be able to see the complete information of each chemical in the table.

2. Creating an regular view based on intent of average users
If the user is someone that just wants to know the chemicals in use, there will be a simplified view that would be easy 
for anyone to understand. They will be able to see the chemical name along with the basic, important components of it in a table.

3. Creating a link between the table and the pie chart
If the user would like to look at the pie chart for a specific facility, then the user can just click on the link that will 
be provided at the far right side of the table.  This will allow easy access to the chemical information for the specific facility.  


### Part 2: Visually identify the ratio of chemicals in each facility

- Implement a pie chart that will take the chemicals at each facility and compare them to each other so that users can view 
the overall concentration of the chemicals.  It will make understanding the data easier and more intuitive for the user.    
                
## Description of the desired end product:
End product will provide a new standard of data clarity for users.  Through the new view of the tables and the additional 
visual representation of the pie charts, the user will be able to have easy access to whatever data they are searching for in 
regards to the chemical usage.  Through the implementation of the different views, they will have access to meaningful information 
on the site rather than information that may be confusing if the user is not familiar with every aspect of the data that is stored 
in the database.  Also, the easier it is for the user to interact with the website, the easier it is for them to learn and understand
new information. The end product will also have a table that will easily link the pie charts with its related cell in the factory 
table.  
                                
## Need for the module and what we expect to achieve:    
The goal of this module is to help ease users into understanding more advanced information. We hope to provide basic information
that is accessible to all users coupled with more advanced information that is available to a select few.  This division caters
to the needs of the individual user in regards to their basic understanding of chemicals found in SOAP registered locations.
  
The pie chart is needed in order to provide a visual representation of the data so that it can ascertained quicker than one would
be able to without the aid.  The data table would be used for more in depth information such as the specific concentrations of more
minute chemicals at the cites.  We also expect to achieve a connection between the table and the pie charts that is easy for the user to get the information they want to in a visual manner from the table.
